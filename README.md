# Alba
A music sheet writer !

Alba is a python project that can write a complete score of a given audio file ! I managed to get a mere 60% of accuracy.

# How does it work ?

Alba uses Fourier decomposition to analyze the spectrum of the audio file and associates frequencies to notes, giving a prototype of what the score looks like !
